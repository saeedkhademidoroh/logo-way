Still camera shot, starting in a soft close-up and easing out to a medium front view. A solid white background fills the scene with minimalist, void-like space. A minimal saffron flower logo is centered as its petals are blown apart by a gentle wind from the left. The petals softly spin in the air, then gradually return to form their original logo position.

Immediately after, the Persian word “آراسته” is handwritten from right to left using a fluid ink-like animation. Each letter appears one by one with a rhythmic, soft pop effect, forming smooth white letters with a thick, hand-drawn purple stroke (#663695). The motion is glossy and organic, like liquid ink flowing with slight variation.

Once complete, the word seamlessly transitions into the English word “Arasteh”, typed left to right using the same hand-drawn purple color (#663695). The letters are clear and smooth, without stroke. Finally, the word “SAFFRON” appears below in capital letters, colored in soft pink (#CB9AC6), also typed letter-by-letter.

All elements stay perfectly centered. The pacing is elegant and fluid, with cinematic polish, clean easing, and no distortion. The tone is timeless and refined, emphasizing bilingual identity through symmetry, rhythm, and visual harmony.
