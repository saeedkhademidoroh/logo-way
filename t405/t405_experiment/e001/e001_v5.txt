Create a dynamic logo animation that breathes life into the brand’s identity. The animation should last between 3 to 10 seconds, incorporating smooth motion, subtle sound effects, and visual elements that reflect the brand’s essence. Maintain the original color scheme, typography, and overall design of the logo. The animation should be versatile for use in promotional videos, brand introductions, and outros. Draw inspiration from renowned logo animations like those of Nike, Google, Apple, DreamWorks, and Paramount
